Include:\n\n1. **index.html** page\n2. **styles folder** with a **main.css**\n3. **js folder** with a **main.js**\n\n**Make sure** to include **[Semantic UI](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/2.2.4/semantic.min.css)** and **[jQuery](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js)** appropriately in the **index.html**.\n\n#### Exercises\n---\n\nCreate a button that, on click, will turn the background color of your page red. \n\n**Stretch goal**: make the color changing toggle!\n\nCreate an input field that, when typed into, will read the value of the field and print it into a div right below.

Then, run jQuery functions on the thing you selected.\n\n**[jQuery Docs](https://api.jquery.com/)**\n\n#### Accordion\n---\n\nWhen a title is clicked, display content. When title is clicked again, hide the content.\n\n#### Dropdown\n---\n\nWhen chosen item is hovered, show options. When not hovered, remove options. If option is clicked, remove options.\n\n#### Dynamic Divs\n---\n\nInput field, when you hit enter, takes content and creates a div on page dynamically. Clicking this div will alert contents of this div.\n\n","idx":4},"plugins":{"content":"# Plugins\n---\n\nPlugins: additional functions written by third party developers that allow you to get complex ui components into your page easily.\n\n#### How to pick a plugin\n---\n\nA few questions to ask yourself:\n\n1. Does it have good documentation?\n2. How many stars does it have on github? (Or, have others used it? Is it written by a reputable company? etc)\n3. When was the last time it was updated? Is it in active development? Is it a dead project?\n4. How many bugs does it have reported?\n5. Does it actualy do what you want? Is it easy to get the functionality that you need?\n\n\n#### [jQuery Plugin Mecca](http://www.unheap.com/)","idx":5},"__list__":["home","title","desc","warmup","ui-components","plugins"]}
